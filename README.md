- **Header Component**: A clean and accessible navigation bar that includes a logo, navigation links, and a "Hire Me" button.
- **Mobile Navigation**: A collapsible menu for mobile devices to facilitate easy navigation.
- **Navigation Component**: Renders the navigation menu with active link highlighting for better user experience.
- **Page Transition**: Smooth transitions between sections to enhance the overall user experience.
- **Rotating Circle Profile Photo**: A profile picture is displayed inside a continuously rotating circle. The circle has a dynamic stroke-dash animation, and the image inside fades in with a slight delay after the page reloads. This animation is achieved using `Framer Motion`.

  - The rotation and stroke-dash animation create a smooth visual experience, with the image being statically displayed inside the circle.

- **Animated Social Media Icons**: Social media icons are displayed, linking to Ammar's GitHub, LinkedIn, Upwork, and Fiverr profiles. The icons are interactive and designed using `React Icons`.

  - These links are styled to match the portfolio's design and allow users to connect easily.

- **Animated Stairs Transition**: A set of animated stairs provides a unique page transition effect. Each "stair" is a div that moves smoothly across the screen during page changes, creating a staggered staircase effect using `Framer Motion`.

  - The stair animation runs in reverse when the component exits, adding a dynamic visual effect to the transition between pages.

- **Stair Transition Handler**: This feature manages the page transitions with stairs using `AnimatePresence` from `Framer Motion`. When navigating between pages, the stair effect adds a layer of sophistication to the portfolio.

- **Stats Section**: An animated statistics section using the `CountUp` library to display key stats like "Months of Experience", "Projects Completed", and "Technologies Used". Each stat is animated, providing an engaging experience.

  - This section highlights Ammar's professional milestones with animated counters.
